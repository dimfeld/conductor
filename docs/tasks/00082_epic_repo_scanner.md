1. Epic Overview:
The Repo Scanner epic focuses on creating a comprehensive system for analyzing and documenting the codebase structure, interfaces, and changes over time. This system will automatically generate and maintain up-to-date documentation about the project's architecture, package relationships, and code conventions, facilitating better understanding and maintenance of the codebase.

2. Key Components and Features:
   - Workspace Analysis System: Scans and tracks multiple workspaces/branches
   - Package Documentation Generator: Creates and updates package overview documents
   - Interface Analyzer: Documents internal and external package interfaces
   - Code Convention Detector: Identifies and documents coding patterns and standards
   - Change Tracking System: Maintains change history documents per package
   - Documentation Aggregator: Combines package-level docs into system-wide architecture documentation

3. Relation to Existing Files:
   Builds upon and extends existing files:
   - src/lib/project/analyze_file.ts: Enhance for more detailed file analysis
   - src/lib/project/file_map.ts: Extend to support package-level organization
   - src/lib/project/server/plan.ts: Integrate with documentation generation
   - src/lib/server/db/schema.ts: Add tables for tracking packages and interfaces
   - src/lib/project/infer_project_settings.ts: Expand for detecting code conventions

4. Stories and Tasks:
   2.1 Workspace awareness
   - Implement workspace detection for git and jujutsu
   - Track active branches and workspaces
   - Monitor workspace state changes

   2.2 Package Overview Document
   - Generate package structure analysis
   - Create package dependency graphs
   - Document package responsibilities

   2.3 Package internal interfaces
   - Analyze and document internal APIs
   - Track interface changes
   - Generate interface documentation

   2.4 Package external interfaces
   - Document public APIs
   - Track API versioning
   - Generate API documentation

   2.5 Code Conventions
   - Detect coding patterns
   - Document style guidelines
   - Track convention adherence

   2.6-2.8 Documentation Management
   - Implement change tracking
   - Update documentation automatically
   - Generate system-wide architecture docs

5. Implementation Considerations:
   5.1 Challenges and Risks:
   - Handling large codebases efficiently
   - Maintaining documentation accuracy
   - Managing concurrent workspace updates

   5.2 Dependencies:
   - Requires Core Infrastructure completion
   - Needs database schema updates
   - Depends on file analysis system

   5.3 Architectural Decisions:
   - Use incremental scanning for performance
   - Implement observer pattern for change detection
   - Store documentation in markdown/YAML format

   5.4 Performance and Scalability:
   - Implement caching for scan results
   - Use parallel processing for analysis
   - Optimize for large codebases

   5.5 Security and Compliance:
   - Ensure sensitive information is not exposed
   - Implement access controls for documentation
   - Follow data protection guidelines

6. Timeline and Impact:
   - Should be implemented after Core Infrastructure
   - Will support subsequent epics with codebase insights
   - Estimated timeline: 2-3 sprints
   - Critical for maintaining project documentation

7. Success Criteria:
   - All packages have complete documentation
   - Interface changes are automatically tracked
   - Code conventions are clearly documented
   - Documentation updates within 5 minutes of code changes
   - System-wide architecture document is accurate and current
   - Zero manual documentation maintenance required

8. Additional Notes:
   - Consider implementing documentation validation
   - Add support for custom documentation templates
   - Include metrics for documentation coverage
   - Plan for future integration with external documentation tools
   - Consider implementing documentation search functionality
   - Prefer to use the filesystem as the source of truth, instead of storing scan results in the database.
