# .svelte.js and .svelte.ts files

Besides `.svelte` files, Svelte also operates on `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files. These behave like any other `.js` or `.ts` module, except that you can use runes. This is useful for creating reusable reactive logic, or sharing reactive state across your app. > This is a concept that didn't exist prior to Svelte 5

# What are runes?

> > A letter or mark used as a mystical or magic symbol. Runes are symbols that you use in `.svelte` and `.svelte.js`/`.svelte.ts` files to control the Svelte compiler. If you think of Svelte as a language, runes are part of the syntax — they are _keywords_. Runes have a `$` prefix and look like functions: ```js let message = $state('hello'); ``` They differ from normal JavaScript functions in important ways, however: - You don't need to import them — they are part of the language - They're not values — you can't assign them to a variable or pass them as arguments to a function - Just like JavaScript keywords, they are only valid in certain positions (the compiler will help you if you put them in the wrong place) > Runes didn't exist prior to Svelte 5.

# $state

The `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes. ```svelte <script> let count = $state(0); </script> <button onclick={() => count++}> clicks: {count} </button> ``` Unlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable. ### Deep state If `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates. State is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object. In a case like this... ```js let todos = $state([ { done: false, text: 'add more todos' } ]); ``` ...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property: ```js let todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }]; // ---cut--- todos[0].done = !todos[0].done; ``` If you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified: ```js // @filename: ambient.d.ts declare global { const todos: Array<{ done: boolean, text: string }> } // @filename: index.js // ---cut--- todos.push({ done: false, text: 'eat lunch' }); ``` Note that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring: ```js let todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }]; // ---cut--- let { done, text } = todos[0]; // this will not affect the value of `done` todos[0].done = !todos[0].done; ``` ### Classes You can also use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private): ```js // @errors: 7006 2554 class Todo { done = $state(false); text = $state(); constructor(text) { this.text = text; } reset() { this.text = ''; this.done = false; } } ``` When calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`: ```svelte <button onclick={todo.reset}> reset </button> ``` You can either use an inline function... ```svelte <button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++ reset </button> ``` ...or use an arrow function in the class definition: ```js // @errors: 7006 2554 class Todo { done = $state(false); text = $state(); constructor(text) { this.text = text; } +++reset = () => {+++ this.text = ''; this.done = false; } } ``` ## `$state.raw` In cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`. State declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it: ```js let person = $state.raw({ name: 'Heraclitus', age: 49 }); // this will have no effect person.age += 1; // this will work, because we're creating a new person person = { name: 'Heraclitus', age: 50 }; ``` This can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects). ## `$state.snapshot` To take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`: ```svelte <script> let counter = $state({ count: 0 }); function onclick() { // Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }` console.log($state.snapshot(counter)); } </script> ``` This is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`. ## Passing state into functions JavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words: ```js /// file: index.js // @filename: index.js // ---cut--- /** * @param {number} a * @param {number} b */ function add(a, b) { return a + b; } let a = 1; let b = 2; let total = add(a, b); console.log(total); // 3 a = 3; b = 4; console.log(total); // still 3! ``` If `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead: ```js /// file: index.js // @filename: index.js // ---cut--- /** * @param {() => number} getA * @param {() => number} getB */ function add(+++getA, getB+++) { return +++() => getA() + getB()+++; } let a = 1; let b = 2; let total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++; console.log(+++total()+++); // 3 a = 3; b = 4; console.log(+++total()+++); // 7 ``` State in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune... ```js let a = +++$state(1)+++; let b = +++$state(2)+++; ``` ...you're accessing its _current value_. Note that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties... ```js /// file: index.js // @filename: index.js // ---cut--- /** * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input */ function add(input) { return { get value() { return input.a + input.b; } }; } let input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 }); let total = add(input); console.log(total.value); // 3 input.a = 3; input.b = 4; console.log(total.value); // 7 ``` ...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.

# $derived

Derived state is declared with the `$derived` rune: ```svelte <script> let count = $state(0); let doubled = $derived(count * 2); </script> <button onclick={() => count++}> {doubled} </button> <p>{count} doubled is {doubled}</p> ``` The expression inside `$derived(...)` should be free of side-effects. Svelte will disallow state changes (e.g. `count++`) inside derived expressions. As with `$state`, you can mark class fields as `$derived`. ## `$derived.by` Sometimes you need to create complex derivations that don't fit inside a short expression. In these cases, you can use `$derived.by` which accepts a function as its argument. ```svelte <script> let numbers = $state([1, 2, 3]); let total = $derived.by(() => { let total = 0; for (const n of numbers) { total += n; } return total; }); </script> <button onclick={() => numbers.push(numbers.length + 1)}> {numbers.join(' + ')} = {total} </button> ``` In essence, `$derived(expression)` is equivalent to `$derived.by(() => expression)`. ## Understanding dependencies Anything read synchronously inside the `$derived` expression (or `$derived.by` function body) is considered a _dependency_ of the derived state. When the state changes, the derived will be marked as _dirty_ and recalculated when it is next read. To exempt a piece of state from being treated as a dependency, use [`untrack`](svelte#untrack).

# $effect

Effects are what make your application _do things_. When Svelte runs an effect function, it tracks which pieces of state (and derived state) are accessed (unless accessed inside [`untrack`](svelte#untrack)), and re-runs the function when that state later changes. Most of the effects in a Svelte app are created by Svelte itself — they're the bits that update the text in `<h1>hello {name}!</h1>` when `name` changes, for example. But you can also create your own effects with the `$effect` rune, which is useful when you need to synchronize an external system (whether that's a library, or a `<canvas>` element, or something across a network) with state inside your Svelte app. Your effects run after the component has been mounted to the DOM, and in a [microtask](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API/Microtask_guide) after state changes ([demo](/REMOVED)): ```svelte <script> let size = $state(50); let color = $state('#ff3e00'); let canvas; $effect(() => { const context = canvas.getContext('2d'); context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height); // this will re-run whenever `color` or `size` change context.fillStyle = color; context.fillRect(0, 0, size, size); }); </script> <canvas bind:this={canvas} width="100" height="100" /> ``` Re-runs are batched (i.e. changing `color` and `size` in the same moment won't cause two separate runs), and happen after any DOM updates have been applied. You can place `$effect` anywhere, not just at the top level of a component, as long as it is called during component initialization (or while a parent effect is active). It is then tied to the lifecycle of the component (or parent effect) and will therefore destroy itself when the component unmounts (or the parent effect is destroyed). You can return a function from `$effect`, which will run immediately before the effect re-runs, and before it is destroyed ([demo](/REMOVED)). ```svelte <script> let count = $state(0); let milliseconds = $state(1000); $effect(() => { // This will be recreated whenever `milliseconds` changes const interval = setInterval(() => { count += 1; }, milliseconds); return () => { // if a callback is provided, it will run // a) immediately before the effect re-runs // b) when the component is destroyed clearInterval(interval); }; }); </script> <h1>{count}</h1> <button onclick={() => (milliseconds *= 2)}>slower</button> <button onclick={() => (milliseconds /= 2)}>faster</button> ``` ### Understanding dependencies `$effect` automatically picks up any reactive values (`$state`, `$derived`, `$props`) that are _synchronously_ read inside its function body and registers them as dependencies. When those dependencies change, the `$effect` schedules a rerun. Values that are read _asynchronously_ — after an `await` or inside a `setTimeout`, for example — will not be tracked. Here, the canvas will be repainted when `color` changes, but not when `size` changes ([demo](/REMOVED)): ```ts // @filename: index.ts declare let canvas: { width: number; height: number; getContext(type: '2d', options?: CanvasRenderingContext2DSettings): CanvasRenderingContext2D; }; declare let color: string; declare let size: number; // ---cut--- $effect(() => { const context = canvas.getContext('2d'); context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height); // this will re-run whenever `color` changes... context.fillStyle = color; setTimeout(() => { // ...but not when `size` changes context.fillRect(0, 0, size, size); }, 0); }); ``` An effect only reruns when the object it reads changes, not when a property inside it changes. (If you want to observe changes _inside_ an object at dev time, you can use [`$inspect`]($inspect).) ```svelte <script> let state = $state({ value: 0 }); let derived = $derived({ value: state.value * 2 }); // this will run once, because `state` is never reassigned (only mutated) $effect(() => { state; }); // this will run whenever `state.value` changes... $effect(() => { state.value; }); // ...and so will this, because `derived` is a new object each time $effect(() => { derived; }); </script> <button onclick={() => (state.value += 1)}> {state.value} </button> <p>{state.value} doubled is {derived.value}</p> ``` An effect only depends on the values that it read the last time it ran. If `a` is true, changes to `b` will [not cause this effect to rerun](/REMOVED): ```ts let a = false; let b = false; // ---cut--- $effect(() => { console.log('running'); if (a || b) { console.log('inside if block'); } }); ``` ## `$effect.pre` In rare cases, you may need to run code _before_ the DOM updates. For this we can use the `$effect.pre` rune: ```svelte <script> import { tick } from 'svelte'; let div = $state(); let messages = $state([]); // ... $effect.pre(() => { if (!div) return; // not yet mounted // reference `messages` array length so that this code re-runs whenever it changes messages.length; // autoscroll when new messages are added if (div.offsetHeight + div.scrollTop > div.scrollHeight - 20) { tick().then(() => { div.scrollTo(0, div.scrollHeight); }); } }); </script> <div bind:this={div}> {#each messages as message} <p>{message}</p> {/each} </div> ``` Apart from the timing, `$effect.pre` works exactly like `$effect`. ## `$effect.tracking` The `$effect.tracking` rune is an advanced feature that tells you whether or not the code is running inside a tracking context, such as an effect or inside your template ([demo](/REMOVED)): ```svelte <script> console.log('in component setup:', $effect.tracking()); // false $effect(() => { console.log('in effect:', $effect.tracking()); // true }); </script> <p>in template: {$effect.tracking()}</p> <!-- true --> ``` This allows you to (for example) add things like subscriptions without causing memory leaks, by putting them in child effects. Here's a `readable` function that listens to changes from a callback function as long as it's inside a tracking context: ```ts import { tick } from 'svelte'; export default function readable<T>( initial_value: T, start: (callback: (update: (v: T) => T) => T) => () => void ) { let value = $state(initial_value); let subscribers = 0; let stop: null | (() => void) = null; return { get value() { // If in a tracking context ... if ($effect.tracking()) { $effect(() => { // ...and there's no subscribers yet... if (subscribers === 0) { // ...invoke the function and listen to changes to update state stop = start((fn) => (value = fn(value))); } subscribers++; // The return callback is called once a listener unlistens return () => { tick().then(() => { subscribers--; // If it was the last subscriber... if (subscribers === 0) { // ...stop listening to changes stop?.(); stop = null; } }); }; }); } return value; } }; } ``` ## `$effect.root` The `$effect.root` rune is an advanced feature that creates a non-tracked scope that doesn't auto-cleanup. This is useful for nested effects that you want to manually control. This rune also allows for the creation of effects outside of the component initialisation phase. ```svelte <script> let count = $state(0); const cleanup = $effect.root(() => { $effect(() => { console.log(count); }); return () => { console.log('effect root cleanup'); }; }); </script> ``` ## When not to use `$effect` In general, `$effect` is best considered something of an escape hatch — useful for things like analytics and direct DOM manipulation — rather than a tool you should use frequently. In particular, avoid using it to synchronise state. Instead of this... ```svelte <script> let count = $state(0); let doubled = $state(); // don't do this! $effect(() => { doubled = count * 2; }); </script> ``` ...do this: ```svelte <script> let count = $state(0); let doubled = $derived(count * 2); </script> ``` You might be tempted to do something convoluted with effects to link one value to another. The following example shows two inputs for "money spent" and "money left" that are connected to each other. If you update one, the other should update accordingly. Don't use effects for this ([demo](/REMOVED)): ```svelte <script> let total = 100; let spent = $state(0); let left = $state(total); $effect(() => { left = total - spent; }); $effect(() => { spent = total - left; }); </script> <label> <input type="range" bind:value={spent} max={total} /> {spent}/{total} spent </label> <label> <input type="range" bind:value={left} max={total} /> {left}/{total} left </label> ``` Instead, use callbacks where possible ([demo](/REMOVED)): ```svelte <script> let total = 100; let spent = $state(0); let left = $state(total); function updateSpent(e) { spent = +e.target.value; left = total - spent; } function updateLeft(e) { left = +e.target.value; spent = total - left; } </script> <label> <input type="range" value={spent} oninput={updateSpent} max={total} /> {spent}/{total} spent </label> <label> <input type="range" value={left} oninput={updateLeft} max={total} /> {left}/{total} left </label> ``` If you need to use bindings, for whatever reason (for example when you want some kind of "writable `$derived`"), consider using getters and setters to synchronise state ([demo](/REMOVED)): ```svelte <script> let total = 100; let spent = $state(0); let left = { get value() { return total - spent; }, set value(v) { spent = total - v; } }; </script> <label> <input type="range" bind:value={spent} max={total} /> {spent}/{total} spent </label> <label> <input type="range" bind:value={left.value} max={total} /> {left.value}/{total} left </label> ``` If you absolutely have to update `$state` within an effect and run into an infinite loop because you read and write to the same `$state`, use [untrack](svelte#untrack).

# $props

The inputs to a component are referred to as _props_, which is short for _properties_. You pass props to components just like you pass attributes to elements: ```svelte <!--- file: App.svelte ---> <script> import MyComponent from './MyComponent.svelte'; </script> <MyComponent adjective="cool" /> ``` On the other side, inside `MyComponent.svelte`, we can receive props with the `$props` rune... ```svelte <!--- file: MyComponent.svelte ---> <script> let props = $props(); </script> <p>this component is {props.adjective}</p> ``` ...though more commonly, you'll [_destructure_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) your props: ```svelte <!--- file: MyComponent.svelte ---> <script> let +++{ adjective }+++ = $props(); </script> <p>this component is {+++adjective+++}</p> ``` ## Fallback values Destructuring allows us to declare fallback values, which are used if the parent component does not set a given prop: ```js let { adjective = 'happy' } = $props(); ``` ## Renaming props We can also use the destructuring assignment to rename props, which is necessary if they're invalid identifiers, or a JavaScript keyword like `super`: ```js let { super: trouper = 'lights are gonna find me' } = $props(); ``` ## Rest props Finally, we can use a _rest property_ to get, well, the rest of the props: ```js let { a, b, c, ...others } = $props(); ``` ## Updating props References to a prop inside a component update when the prop itself updates — when `count` changes in `App.svelte`, it will also change inside `Child.svelte`. But the child component is able to temporarily override the prop value, which can be useful for unsaved ephemeral state ([demo](/REMOVED)): ```svelte <!--- file: App.svelte ---> <script> import Child from './Child.svelte'; let count = $state(0); </script> <button onclick={() => (count += 1)}> clicks (parent): {count} </button> <Child {count} /> ``` ```svelte <!--- file: Child.svelte ---> <script> let { count } = $props(); </script> <button onclick={() => (count += 1)}> clicks (child): {count} </button> ``` While you can temporarily _reassign_ props, you should not _mutate_ props unless they are [bindable]($bindable). If the prop is a regular object, the mutation will have no effect ([demo](/REMOVED)): ```svelte <!--- file: App.svelte ---> <script> import Child from './Child.svelte'; </script> <Child object={{ count: 0 }} /> ``` ```svelte <!--- file: Child.svelte ---> <script> let { object } = $props(); </script> <button onclick={() => { // has no effect object.count += 1 }}> clicks: {object.count} </button> ``` If the prop is a reactive state proxy, however, then mutations _will_ have an effect but you will see an [`ownership_invalid_mutation`](runtime-warnings#Client-warnings-ownership_invalid_mutation) warning, because the component is mutating state that does not 'belong' to it ([demo](/REMOVED)): ```svelte <!--- file: App.svelte ---> <script> import Child from './Child.svelte'; let object = $state({count: 0}); </script> <Child {object} /> ``` ```svelte <!--- file: Child.svelte ---> <script> let { object } = $props(); </script> <button onclick={() => { // will cause the count below to update, // but with a warning. Don't mutate // objects you don't own! object.count += 1 }}> clicks: {object.count} </button> ``` The fallback value of a prop not declared with `$bindable` is left untouched — it is not turned into a reactive state proxy — meaning mutations will not cause updates ([demo](/REMOVED)) ```svelte <!--- file: Child.svelte ---> <script> let { object = { count: 0 } } = $props(); </script> <button onclick={() => { // has no effect if the fallback value is used object.count += 1 }}> clicks: {object.count} </button> ``` In summary: don't mutate props. Either use callback props to communicate changes, or — if parent and child should share the same object — use the [`$bindable`]($bindable) rune. ## Type safety You can add type safety to your components by annotating your props, as you would with any other variable declaration. In TypeScript that might look like this... ```svelte <script lang="ts"> let { adjective }: { adjective: string } = $props(); </script> ``` ...while in JSDoc you can do this: ```svelte <script> /** @type {{ adjective: string }} */ let { adjective } = $props(); </script> ``` You can, of course, separate the type declaration from the annotation: ```svelte <script lang="ts"> interface Props { adjective: string; } let { adjective }: Props = $props(); </script> ``` Adding types is recommended, as it ensures that people using your component can easily discover which props they should provide.

# $bindable

Ordinarily, props go one way, from parent to child. This makes it easy to understand how data flows around your app. In Svelte, component props can be _bound_, which means that data can also flow _up_ from child to parent. This isn't something you should do often, but it can simplify your code if used sparingly and carefully. It also means that a state proxy can be _mutated_ in the child. To mark a prop as bindable, we use the `$bindable` rune: ```svelte /// file: FancyInput.svelte <script> let { value = $bindable(), ...props } = $props(); </script> <input bind:value={value} {...props} /> <style> input { font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'; color: deeppink; } </style> ``` Now, a component that uses `<FancyInput>` can add the [`bind:`](bind) directive ([demo](/REMOVED)): ```svelte /// App.svelte <script> import FancyInput from './FancyInput.svelte'; let message = $state('hello'); </script> <FancyInput bind:value={message} /> <p>{message}</p> ``` The parent component doesn't _have_ to use `bind:` — it can just pass a normal prop. Some parents don't want to listen to what their children have to say. In this case, you can specify a fallback value for when no prop is passed at all: ```js /// file: FancyInput.svelte let { value = $bindable('fallback'), ...props } = $props(); ```

# $inspect

The `$inspect` rune is roughly equivalent to `console.log`, with the exception that it will re-run whenever its argument changes. `$inspect` tracks reactive state deeply, meaning that updating something inside an object or array using fine-grained reactivity will cause it to re-fire ([demo](/REMOVED)): ```svelte <script> let count = $state(0); let message = $state('hello'); $inspect(count, message); // will console.log when `count` or `message` change </script> <button onclick={() => count++}>Increment</button> <input bind:value={message} /> ``` ## $inspect(...).with `$inspect` returns a property `with`, which you can invoke with a callback, which will then be invoked instead of `console.log`. The first argument to the callback is either `"init"` or `"update"`; subsequent arguments are the values passed to `$inspect` ([demo](/REMOVED)): ```svelte <script> let count = $state(0); $inspect(count).with((type, count) => { if (type === 'update') { debugger; // or `console.trace`, or whatever you want } }); </script> <button onclick={() => count++}>Increment</button> ``` A convenient way to find the origin of some change is to pass `console.trace` to `with`: ```js // @errors: 2304 $inspect(stuff).with(console.trace); ``` ## $inspect.trace(...) This rune, added in 5.14, causes the surrounding function to be _traced_ in development. Any time the function re-runs as part of an [effect]($effect) or a [derived]($derived), information will be printed to the console about which pieces of reactive state caused the effect to fire. ```svelte <script> import { doSomeWork } from './elsewhere'; $effect(() => { +++$inspect.trace();+++ doSomeWork(); }); </script> ``` `$inspect.trace` takes an optional first argument which will be used as the label.

# Basic markup 

Most of the markup from Svelte 4 still applies, but these are new:

# {#snippet ...}

```svelte <!--- copy: false ---> {#snippet name()}...{/snippet} ``` ```svelte <!--- copy: false ---> {#snippet name(param1, param2, paramN)}...{/snippet} ``` Snippets, and [render tags](@render), are a way to create reusable chunks of markup inside your components. Instead of writing duplicative code like [this](/REMOVED)... ```svelte {#each images as image} {#if image.href} <a href={image.href}> <figure> <img src={image.src} alt={image.caption} width={image.width} height={image.height} /> <figcaption>{image.caption}</figcaption> </figure> </a> {:else} <figure> <img src={image.src} alt={image.caption} width={image.width} height={image.height} /> <figcaption>{image.caption}</figcaption> </figure> {/if} {/each} ``` ...you can write [this](/REMOVED): ```svelte {#snippet figure(image)} <figure> <img src={image.src} alt={image.caption} width={image.width} height={image.height} /> <figcaption>{image.caption}</figcaption> </figure> {/snippet} {#each images as image} {#if image.href} <a href={image.href}> {@render figure(image)} </a> {:else} {@render figure(image)} {/if} {/each} ``` Like function declarations, snippets can have an arbitrary number of parameters, which can have default values, and you can destructure each parameter. You cannot use rest parameters, however. ## Snippet scope Snippets can be declared anywhere inside your component. They can reference values declared outside themselves, for example in the `<script>` tag or in `{#each ...}` blocks ([demo](/REMOVED))... ```svelte <script> let { message = `it's great to see you!` } = $props(); </script> {#snippet hello(name)} <p>hello {name}! {message}!</p> {/snippet} {@render hello('alice')} {@render hello('bob')} ``` ...and they are 'visible' to everything in the same lexical scope (i.e. siblings, and children of those siblings): ```svelte <div> {#snippet x()} {#snippet y()}...{/snippet} <!-- this is fine --> {@render y()} {/snippet} <!-- this will error, as `y` is not in scope --> {@render y()} </div> <!-- this will also error, as `x` is not in scope --> {@render x()} ``` Snippets can reference themselves and each other ([demo](/REMOVED)): ```svelte {#snippet blastoff()} <span>🚀</span> {/snippet} {#snippet countdown(n)} {#if n > 0} <span>{n}...</span> {@render countdown(n - 1)} {:else} {@render blastoff()} {/if} {/snippet} {@render countdown(10)} ``` ## Passing snippets to components Within the template, snippets are values just like any other. As such, they can be passed to components as props ([demo](/REMOVED)): ```svelte <script> import Table from './Table.svelte'; const fruits = [ { name: 'apples', qty: 5, price: 2 }, { name: 'bananas', qty: 10, price: 1 }, { name: 'cherries', qty: 20, price: 0.5 } ]; </script> {#snippet header()} <th>fruit</th> <th>qty</th> <th>price</th> <th>total</th> {/snippet} {#snippet row(d)} <td>{d.name}</td> <td>{d.qty}</td> <td>{d.price}</td> <td>{d.qty * d.price}</td> {/snippet} <Table data={fruits} {header} {row} /> ``` Think about it like passing content instead of data to a component. The concept is similar to slots in web components. As an authoring convenience, snippets declared directly _inside_ a component implicitly become props _on_ the component ([demo](/REMOVED)): ```svelte <!-- this is semantically the same as the above --> <Table data={fruits}> {#snippet header()} <th>fruit</th> <th>qty</th> <th>price</th> <th>total</th> {/snippet} {#snippet row(d)} <td>{d.name}</td> <td>{d.qty}</td> <td>{d.price}</td> <td>{d.qty * d.price}</td> {/snippet} </Table> ``` Any content inside the component tags that is _not_ a snippet declaration implicitly becomes part of the `children` snippet ([demo](/REMOVED)): ```svelte <!--- file: App.svelte ---> <Button>click me</Button> ``` ```svelte <!--- file: Button.svelte ---> <script> let { children } = $props(); </script> <!-- result will be <button>click me</button> --> <button>{@render children()}</button> ``` You can declare snippet props as being optional. You can either use optional chaining to not render anything if the snippet isn't set... ```svelte <script> let { children } = $props(); </script> {@render children?.()} ``` ...or use an `#if` block to render fallback content: ```svelte <script> let { children } = $props(); </script> {#if children} {@render children()} {:else} fallback content {/if} ``` ## Typing snippets Snippets implement the `Snippet` interface imported from `'svelte'`: ```svelte <script lang="ts"> import type { Snippet } from 'svelte'; interface Props { data: any[]; children: Snippet; row: Snippet<[any]>; } let { data, children, row }: Props = $props(); </script> ``` With this change, red squigglies will appear if you try and use the component without providing a `data` prop and a `row` snippet. Notice that the type argument provided to `Snippet` is a tuple, since snippets can have multiple parameters. We can tighten things up further by declaring a generic, so that `data` and `row` refer to the same type: ```svelte <script lang="ts" generics="T"> import type { Snippet } from 'svelte'; let { data, children, row }: { data: T[]; children: Snippet; row: Snippet<[T]>; } = $props(); </script> ``` ## Exporting snippets Snippets declared at the top level of a `.svelte` file can be exported from a `<script module>` for use in other components, provided they don't reference any declarations in a non-module `<script>` (whether directly or indirectly, via other snippets) ([demo](/REMOVED)): ```svelte <script module> export { add }; </script> {#snippet add(a, b)} {a} + {b} = {a + b} {/snippet} ``` > This requires Svelte 5.5.0 or newer ## Programmatic snippets Snippets can be created programmatically with the [`createRawSnippet`](svelte#createRawSnippet) API. This is intended for advanced use cases. ## Snippets and slots In Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using [slots](legacy-slots). Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and as such slots are deprecated in Svelte 5.

# {@render ...}

To render a [snippet](snippet), use a `{@render ...}` tag. ```svelte {#snippet sum(a, b)} <p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p> {/snippet} {@render sum(1, 2)} {@render sum(3, 4)} {@render sum(5, 6)} ``` The expression can be an identifier like `sum`, or an arbitrary JavaScript expression: ```svelte {@render (cool ? coolSnippet : lameSnippet)()} ``` ## Optional snippets If the snippet is potentially undefined — for example, because it's an incoming prop — then you can use optional chaining to only render it when it _is_ defined: ```svelte {@render children?.()} ``` Alternatively, use an [`{#if ...}`](if) block with an `:else` clause to render fallback content: ```svelte {#if children} {@render children()} {:else} <p>fallback content</p> {/if} ```
