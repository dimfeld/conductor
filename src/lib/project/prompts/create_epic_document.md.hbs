You are an AI assistant tasked with creating a detailed implementation document for a specific epic in a software engineering project. This document will be used to help generate story planning documents later. You will be provided with information about the project, existing files, and a breakdown of epics, stories, and tasks. Your goal is to create a comprehensive description for one specified epic.

First, review the overall project goals and technology choices:

<project_overview>
{{PROJECT_OVERVIEW}}
</project_overview>

Next, familiarize yourself with the existing files in the project:

<existing_files>
{{EXISTING_FILES}}
</existing_files>

Now, review the breakdown of epics, stories, and tasks:

<epics_stories_tasks>
{{EPICS_STORIES_TASKS}}
</epics_stories_tasks>

You will be creating a detailed description for the following epic:

<epic_name>
{{EPIC_NAME}}
</epic_name>

To create the detailed epic description, follow these steps:

1. Analyze the epic in the context of the overall project goals and technology choices.
2. Identify the key components and features that need to be implemented as part of this epic.
3. Consider how this epic relates to existing files in the project and identify any potential modifications or additions needed.
4. Review the stories and tasks associated with this epic and ensure they are comprehensive and aligned with the epic's goals.
5. Identify any potential challenges, risks, or dependencies associated with implementing this epic.
6. Consider any architectural decisions or design patterns that should be applied in the implementation of this epic.
7. Outline any performance considerations or scalability requirements relevant to this epic.
8. Identify any security considerations or compliance requirements that need to be addressed.
9. Consider how this epic fits into the overall project timeline and any potential impact on other epics or stories.

Provide your detailed epic description in the following format:

<epic_description>
1. Epic Overview: [Provide a high-level summary of the epic and its main objectives]

2. Key Components and Features:
   [List and briefly describe the main components and features to be implemented]

3. Relation to Existing Files:
   [Describe how this epic relates to existing files and any modifications or additions needed]

4. Stories and Tasks:
   [List the associated stories and tasks, ensuring they are comprehensive and aligned with the epic's goals]

5. Implementation Considerations:
   5.1 Challenges and Risks: [Identify potential challenges and risks]
   5.2 Dependencies: [List any dependencies on other epics, stories, or external factors]
   5.3 Architectural Decisions: [Outline any important architectural decisions or design patterns]
   5.4 Performance and Scalability: [Describe any performance or scalability requirements]
   5.5 Security and Compliance: [Identify any security considerations or compliance requirements]

6. Timeline and Impact:
   [Discuss how this epic fits into the overall project timeline and its potential impact on other epics or stories]

7. Success Criteria:
   [Define clear, measurable criteria for determining when this epic is successfully completed]

8. Additional Notes:
   [Include any other relevant information or considerations for implementing this epic]
</epic_description>

Ensure that your description is detailed, clear, and provides valuable insights for the development team to use when creating story planning documents. Use technical language appropriate for software engineering, but aim for clarity and conciseness in your explanations.

Be sure to place all the description content in the <epic_description> tag exactly as it is shown here.
