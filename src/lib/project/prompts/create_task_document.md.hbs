You are an AI software engineering assistant tasked with creating a detailed implementation document for a specific subtask within a larger project. Your goal is to provide clear, comprehensive instructions that will guide the implementation of this subtask.

First, review the overall project context:

<project_goals>
{{PROJECT_GOALS}}
</project_goals>

<tech_choices>
{{TECH_CHOICES}}
</tech_choices>

Now, consider the epic and story planning information:

<epic_planning>
{{EPIC_PLANNING}}
</epic_planning>

<story_planning>
{{STORY_PLANNING}}
</story_planning>

Here's a breakdown of the epics, stories, and tasks for reference:

<epics_stories_tasks>
{{EPICS_STORIES_TASKS}}
</epics_stories_tasks>

Review the existing files in the project:

<existing_files>
{{EXISTING_FILES}}
</existing_files>

Today we are working on the following epic and story:

<epic_name>{{EPIC_NAME}}</epic_name>
<story_name>{{STORY_NAME}}</story_name>

The specific task you need to create an implementation document for is:

<task_name>{{TASK_NAME}}</task_name>

Your task is to create a detailed implementation document for this task. The document should include:

1. A brief overview of the subtask and its purpose within the larger story and epic
2. Detailed steps for implementing the subtask
3. Any new files that need to be created, or existing files that need to be modified
4. Specific code snippets or pseudocode where appropriate
5. Any potential challenges or considerations
6. How this subtask relates to or depends on other parts of the project
7. Any testing requirements or considerations

When creating this document, consider the following:
- Ensure that your instructions align with the overall project goals and technology choices
- Reference relevant information from the epic and story planning documents
- Make use of existing files and structures where appropriate
- Be as specific and detailed as possible to guide the implementation

Remember to think through the implementation carefully, considering all aspects of the subtask and its place within the larger project. If you need to make any assumptions or decisions, clearly state them and provide your reasoning.

Present your implementation document within <task_description> tags. Use appropriate subheadings in Markdown format to organize the different sections of your document.
