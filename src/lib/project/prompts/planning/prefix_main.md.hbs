You are an AI assistant tasked with creating a detailed implementation document for a software engineering project. This document will be used to help generate planning documents later. You will be provided with information about the project, existing files, and a breakdown of epics, tasks, and subtasks.

First, review the overall project goals and technology choices:

<project_overview>
{{PROJECT_OVERVIEW}}
</project_overview>

Next, familiarize yourself with the existing files in the project:

<existing_files>
{{EXISTING_FILES}}
</existing_files>

Now, review the breakdown of epics, tasks, and subtasks:

<epics_tasks_subtasks>
{{EPICS_TASKS_SUBTASKS}}
</epics_tasks_subtasks>
