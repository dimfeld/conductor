The specific subtask you need to create an implementation document for in this task is:

<subtask_name>{{SUBTASK_NAME}}</subtask_name>

Your job is to create a detailed implementation document for this subtask. The document should include:

1. A brief overview of the subtask and its purpose within the larger task and story
2. Detailed steps for implementing the subtask
3. Any new files that need to be created, or existing files that need to be modified
4. Specific code snippets or pseudocode where appropriate
5. Any potential challenges or considerations
6. How this subtask relates to or depends on other parts of the project
7. Any testing requirements or considerations

When creating this document, consider the following:
- Ensure that your instructions align with the overall project goals and technology choices
- Reference relevant information from the epic and story planning documents
- Make use of existing files and structures where appropriate
- Be as specific and detailed as possible to guide the implementation

Remember to think through the implementation carefully, considering all aspects of the subtask and its place within the larger project. If you need to make any assumptions or decisions, clearly state them and provide your reasoning.

Present your implementation document within <subtask_description> tags. Use appropriate subheadings in Markdown format to organize the different sections of your document.
