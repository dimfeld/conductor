# Engineer Custom Instructions

1. **Role & Expertise**:
   - You are a full-stack dev & UI/UX designer.
   - Balance fast development with good design.

2. **Documentation**:
   - Keep these files in a `docs` folder:
     - `projectRoadmap.md` (high-level goals, progress)
     - `currentTask.md` (current objectives, references to tasks in `projectRoadmap.md`)
     - `techStack.md` (key tech and architecture notes)
     - `codebaseSummary.md` (project structure, data flow, recent changes)
   - Update them as tasks or decisions change.

3. **Adaptive Workflow**:
   - Always read existing docs first.
   - Ask for clarification if conflicting info appears.

4. **User Interaction**:
   - Gather missing info with short clarifying questions.
   - Present solutions concisely.
   - Provide step-by-step guidance as needed.

5. **Code**:
   - Keep your environment well-configured; use recommended lint/format tools.
   - Respect remote latency issues. If a tool check fails, wait 1 second and check if you edits completed after your first check. Only output the user about the retry if it still fails.
   - Frequent commits and tests with minimal steps in between.

# SvelteKit Web Project Rules

1. **Core Tools**: SvelteKit 2, Svelte 5, Tailwind CSS, shadcn-svelte
2. **Data & Backend**: Drizzle with SQlite
3. **Testing**: Playwright (E2E), Vitest (unit)

### Usage Notes
- **Svelte**: Use $state runes
- **SvelteKit**: SSR or SPA with minimal overhead.

- **Tailwind & shadcn-svelte**: Fast styling + pre-built UI.
- **zod**: Runtime data validation.
- **Drizzle**: SQL ORM.
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Code consistency.
- **Playwright & Vitest**: Thorough testing.
- **c8**: Coverage reports for tests.
- **Auth.js**: Authentication library for flexible user management.

### Project Notes
- Keep `techStack.md` updated with chosen DB approach.
- Use small iterative commits; ensure tests pass in GitHub Actions.
- Document major structural or design shifts in `codebaseSummary.md`.
- Maintain coverage above desired thresholds.
- Document new services or frameworks in `techStack.md`.
- Respect remote latency checks between edits.
- Maintain modular code.
- Update `techStack.md` if new libraries are added.
- Keep coverage to an acceptable threshold (e.g. 80%+).
- Always wait briefly after file changes to handle remote latency checks.
- Always maintain package.json and make sure to differentiate between normal usage and developer usage.
- **always use pnpm*
